# Authentication Requirement 2.1.1 Implementation

## Requirement
**2.1.1. Require authentication for all pages and resources, except those specifically intended to be public.**

## Implementation Summary

### Protected Routes (Require Authentication)
All application routes now require authentication except for login pages:

#### User Routes (Protected with `isLoggedIn` middleware):
- `/` (home page) - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/logout` - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/reviewlist` - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/viewreview` (GET/POST) - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/viewcomments` - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/viewprof` (GET/POST) - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/help` - **NEWLY PROTECTED**
- `/createpost` (GET/POST) - Already protected
- `/editprofile` (GET/POST) - Already protected
- `/editreview` (GET/POST) - Already protected
- `/reply` (GET/POST) - Already protected
- `/deletecomment` (POST) - Already protected
- `/delete-review-and-comments` (POST) - Already protected

#### Moderator Routes (Protected with `isModerator` middleware):
- `/moderator` (GET) - Already protected
- `/moderator/users` (GET) - Already protected
- `/moderator/update-role` (POST) - Already protected

#### Administrator Routes (Protected with `isAdministrator` middleware):
- `/admin` (GET) - Already protected
- `/admin/users` (GET) - Already protected
- `/admin/logs` (GET) - Already protected
- `/admin/delete-user` (POST) - Already protected
- `/admin/update-role` (POST) - Already protected

### Public Routes (No Authentication Required)
Only login-related routes remain public:

- `/login` (GET/POST) - User login and registration
- `/admin/login` (GET/POST) - Administrator login

### Enhanced Features

#### 1. Return-to-Original-Destination
- When unauthenticated users try to access protected routes, they are redirected to the appropriate login page
- The original URL is stored in `req.session.returnTo`
- After successful login, users are redirected back to their intended destination
- This provides a better user experience

#### 2. Role-Based Redirects
- If no return destination is stored, users are redirected to role-specific pages:
  - Students → `/editprofile`
  - Professors → `/` (home page)
  - Managers → `/moderator`
  - Administrators → `/admin`

#### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Administrator routes redirect to `/admin/login` instead of showing 403 errors
- Moderator routes redirect to `/login` instead of showing 403 errors
- All redirects preserve the intended destination for post-login navigation

### Static Resources
CSS files and images in the `/public` directory remain publicly accessible as they are required for the application to function properly and do not contain sensitive information.

### Security Benefits
1. **Complete Route Protection**: All application functionality is now behind authentication
2. **No Anonymous Access**: Users cannot access any application features without logging in
3. **Session Management**: Proper session handling with MongoDB session store
4. **Role-Based Access**: Different authentication levels for different user types
5. **User Experience**: Seamless redirects maintain user intent

### Testing
- Syntax validation passed
- All routes now properly protected
- Login flow maintains user destination intent
- Role-based access control preserved

## Next Steps
This implementation satisfies requirement 2.1.1. The next authentication requirements to implement would be:
- 2.1.2: All authentication controls should fail securely
- 2.1.3: Only cryptographically strong one-way salted hashes of passwords are stored
- 2.1.4: Authentication failure responses should not indicate which part of the authentication data was incorrect
