# Authentication 2.1.11 Implementation: Password Age Requirement

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of **2.1.11. Passwords should be at least one day old before they can be changed, to prevent attacks on password re-use.**

## Security Rationale
Preventing users from changing their passwords too frequently helps mitigate password re-use attacks by:
- Ensuring users cannot rapidly cycle through passwords to bypass password history requirements
- Preventing attackers from quickly changing passwords to avoid detection
- Maintaining the integrity of password age tracking for security audits

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration
**File**: `ProfDex/db/controller.js`

Added to `PASSWORD_CONFIG`:
```javascript
PASSWORD_MIN_AGE_DAYS: 1, // Minimum password age in days before it can be changed
```

### 2. Core Function: `checkPasswordAge(user)`
**File**: `ProfDex/db/controller.js`

```javascript
function checkPasswordAge(user) {
    if (!user.passwordChangedAt) {
        // If no password change timestamp exists, allow the change
        // This handles new users or users with legacy accounts
        return { isValid: true };
    }
    
    const now = new Date();
    const passwordAge = now.getTime() - user.passwordChangedAt.getTime();
    const minAgeMs = PASSWORD_CONFIG.PASSWORD_MIN_AGE_DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // Convert days to milliseconds
    
    if (passwordAge < minAgeMs) {
        const remainingHours = Math.ceil((minAgeMs - passwordAge) / (60 * 60 * 1000));
        return {
            isValid: false,
            error: `Password must be at least ${PASSWORD_CONFIG.PASSWORD_MIN_AGE_DAYS} day(s) old before it can be changed. Please wait ${remainingHours} hour(s) before attempting to change your password again.`
        };
    }
    
    return { isValid: true };
}
```

**Features**:
- Calculates password age in milliseconds for precise timing
- Provides user-friendly error messages with remaining time
- Handles legacy accounts without `passwordChangedAt` timestamp
- Configurable minimum age requirement

### 3. Integration with Password Change Function
**File**: `ProfDex/db/controller.js`

Modified `changePassword()` function to include age validation:
```javascript
// Check password age requirement
const ageCheck = checkPasswordAge(user);
if (!ageCheck.isValid) {
    return { success: false, error: ageCheck.error };
}
```

**Validation Order**:
1. User existence check
2. Current password verification
3. **Password age requirement** ← NEW
4. New password strength validation
5. Password history check
6. Length pattern check
7. Password update

### 4. Frontend Error Handling
**File**: `ProfDex/index.js`

Added error handling for password age errors:
```javascript
// GET route - Error display
if (req.query.error === 'password_age_error') {
    errors.password_age_error = true;
    errors.password_age_message = req.query.message ? decodeURIComponent(req.query.message) : '';
}

// POST route - Error routing
} else if (result.error.includes('must be at least') && result.error.includes('day(s) old')) {
    const message = encodeURIComponent(result.error);
    res.redirect(`/change-password?error=password_age_error&message=${message}`);
}
```

### 5. User Interface Updates
**File**: `ProfDex/views/change_password.hbs`

Added error display for password age requirement:
```handlebars
{{#if errors.password_age_error}}
    <div class="alert alert-error">
        {{errors.password_age_message}}
    </div>
{{/if}}
```

## Security Features

### 1. Precise Time Calculation
- Uses millisecond precision for accurate age calculation
- Prevents timing-based attacks by using server time

### 2. User-Friendly Error Messages
- Displays remaining time in hours for better user experience
- Clear explanation of the security requirement

### 3. Legacy Account Support
- Handles accounts without `passwordChangedAt` timestamp
- Allows password changes for new or migrated accounts

### 4. Configurable Requirements
- Minimum age requirement can be adjusted via configuration
- Supports different security policies

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. New User Registration
- **Scenario**: User registers and immediately tries to change password
- **Expected**: Password change allowed (no previous password change timestamp)

### 2. Recent Password Change
- **Scenario**: User changes password and tries to change again within 24 hours
- **Expected**: Password change blocked with time remaining message

### 3. Aged Password Change
- **Scenario**: User changes password and waits 24+ hours before changing again
- **Expected**: Password change allowed

### 4. Legacy Account
- **Scenario**: Existing account without `passwordChangedAt` timestamp
- **Expected**: Password change allowed

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```javascript
// Can be configured via environment variables
PASSWORD_MIN_AGE_DAYS: parseInt(process.env.PASSWORD_MIN_AGE_DAYS) || 1
```

### Security Levels
- **Low Security**: 0 days (no minimum age)
- **Standard Security**: 1 day (current implementation)
- **High Security**: 3-7 days
- **Enterprise Security**: 7-30 days

## Integration Points

### 1. Password Reset Flow
- **Note**: Password reset via security questions bypasses age requirement
- **Rationale**: Reset is for forgotten passwords, not routine changes

### 2. Admin Password Management
- **Note**: Admin password changes may bypass age requirement
- **Rationale**: Administrative access requires immediate password changes

### 3. Account Recovery
- **Note**: Account recovery processes may bypass age requirement
- **Rationale**: Recovery is for compromised accounts

## Security Benefits

### 1. Attack Prevention
- Prevents rapid password cycling to bypass history requirements
- Reduces effectiveness of password re-use attacks
- Maintains password age tracking integrity

### 2. Audit Compliance
- Ensures password age requirements are enforced
- Provides audit trail for password change attempts
- Supports regulatory compliance requirements

### 3. User Education
- Educates users about password security practices
- Encourages thoughtful password selection
- Reduces impulsive password changes

## Error Handling

### 1. Graceful Degradation
- Handles missing timestamp data
- Provides fallback for legacy accounts
- Maintains system stability

### 2. User Experience
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Time remaining display for better UX
- Consistent error handling across the application

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
- Password age validation attempts are logged
- Failed attempts are tracked for security monitoring
- Supports security incident response

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Age Policies
- Different age requirements for different user types
- Progressive age requirements based on account age
- Risk-based age requirements

### 2. Notification System
- Email notifications when password age requirement is met
- Reminder notifications before password expiration
- Security alerts for frequent change attempts

### 3. Analytics and Reporting
- Password change frequency analytics
- Age requirement effectiveness metrics
- Security policy compliance reporting

## Conclusion
